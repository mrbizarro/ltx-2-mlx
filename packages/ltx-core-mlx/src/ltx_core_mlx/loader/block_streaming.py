"""Block streaming for low-RAM inference on Apple Silicon.

Stream transformer block weights from a memory-mapped safetensors file
into a single shared block module, so peak resident memory stays at
``~1 block`` instead of ``~num_blocks``. MLX-native equivalent of the
upstream ``ltx_core.block_streaming`` package, but radically simpler:

- Apple Silicon has unified memory, so there is no host-to-device copy.
- ``mx.load(path)`` memory-maps safetensors lazily — opening a 20 GB
  file costs ~40 MB RSS until individual arrays are touched.
- MLX has a single command queue, so there are no streams or events to
  coordinate. Per-block ``mx.clear_cache()`` + dropping references is
  sufficient to keep the resident set bounded.

Architecture
------------
- :class:`BlockStreamer` holds the mmap'd weight dict and a key map
  per block. It exposes :meth:`bind`, which loads block ``i``'s weights
  into a caller-provided ``BasicAVTransformerBlock`` instance.
- A pipeline uses a single shared block module and a :class:`BlockStreamer`,
  passing ``block_provider`` to :meth:`LTXModel.__call__` so the iteration
  loop fetches the bound block per index.
- LoRA fusion can be done up-front into the safetensors-derived dict.
  We do not yet support on-the-fly LoRA fusion per block; the upstream
  cost (matmul on GPU per block) is small but the plumbing is.

Memory profile (LTX-2.3 22B bf16)
---------------------------------
Without streaming: ~22 GB resident for the transformer (48 x ~460 MB).
With streaming: ~460 MB for the active block + non-block params (a few
hundred MB) + mmap metadata (~50 MB) ≈ ~1 GB.
