"""LTX-2 sigma schedules.

`ltx2_schedule` is a thin wrapper over `mlx_arsenal.diffusion.dynamic_shift_schedule`
that preserves LTX's original keyword name (``steps``) and default ``num_tokens``.
The predefined LTX-specific tables (DISTILLED_SIGMAS, STAGE_2_SIGMAS) and the
LTX-only helpers (get_sigma_schedule, sigma_to_timestep) stay local.

**Every schedule this module hands out terminates at sigma 0.0.** A schedule that
stops short does not "run fewer steps" — it returns a latent with residual noise
in it, which then gets attributed to the step count. Asking for fewer steps
therefore *thins* a table (keep both endpoints, drop interior points) rather than
truncating it; a request that cannot be thinned is refused with a message instead
of being quietly served as an unfinished denoise. See :func:`thin_sigmas`.
